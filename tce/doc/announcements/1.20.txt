TTA-based Co-Design Environment (TCE) v1.20 released
----------------------------------------------------

TTA-based Co-Design Environment (TCE) is an open application-specific
instruction-set processor (ASIP) toolset for design and programming of
customized co-processors (typically programmable accelerators). It is
based on the energy efficient Transport Triggered Architecture (TTA)
processor template.

The toolset provides a complete retargetable co-design flow from high-level
language programs down to FPGA/ASIC synthesizable processor RTL (VHDL and
Verilog generation supported) and parallel program binaries.

The size and quantity of register files, function units, supported operations,
and the interconnection network can be freely customized to create new
co-processors ranging from small single-application specific cores with
special operations to generic multi-issue DSPs.

Notable Changes
===============

This release adds support for LLVM 9 and modifies the guard (predicate)
semantics to inspect only the lower bit. It also adds support for compiler
time constant amount shifts, greatly simplifying small designs that do not
need a full shifter.
